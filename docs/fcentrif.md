# Calculation of the centrifugal force

The motion of an object on a surface/curve - and therefore its liftoff behavior -
is determined by the forces acting on it, including the centrifugal force
from the surface/curve. Using the centrifugal force and all other forces,
one can determine whether the object is pressed towards or away from the
surface/curve.

Note that the centrifugal force does not have to correspond to the constraint
force $\lambda \nabla G(q)$ {cite}`theophys{page 202}`.

Let $m$ and $\omega$ be the mass and path velocity of an object on a curve and
$r$ the radius of the curvature. Then the centrifugal force is

$$
  F_z = m \frac{\omega^2}{r}.
$$
