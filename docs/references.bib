abstract = {A new variational principle for mechanical systems subject to holonomic constraints is presented. The newly proposed GGL principle is closely related to the often used Gear-Gupta-Leimkuhler (GGL) stabilization of the differential–algebraic equations governing the motion of constrained mechanical systems. The GGL variational principle relies on an extension of the Livens principle (sometimes also referred to as Hamilton–Pontryagin principle) to mechanical systems subject to holonomic constraints. In contrast to the original GGL stabilization, the new approach facilitates the design of structure-preserving integrators. In particular, new variational integrators are presented, which result from the direct discretization of the GGL variational principle. These variational integrators are symplectic and conserve momentum maps in the case of systems with symmetry. In addition to that, a new energy–momentum scheme is developed, which results from the discretization of the Euler–Lagrange equations pertaining to the GGL variational principle. The numerical properties of the newly devised schemes are investigated in representative examples of constrained mechanical systems.},
