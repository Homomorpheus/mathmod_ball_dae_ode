abstract = {A new variational principle for mechanical systems subject to holonomic constraints is presented. The newly proposed GGL principle is closely related to the often used Gear-Gupta-Leimkuhler (GGL) stabilization of the differential–algebraic equations governing the motion of constrained mechanical systems. The GGL variational principle relies on an extension of the Livens principle (sometimes also referred to as Hamilton–Pontryagin principle) to mechanical systems subject to holonomic constraints. In contrast to the original GGL stabilization, the new approach facilitates the design of structure-preserving integrators. In particular, new variational integrators are presented, which result from the direct discretization of the GGL variational principle. These variational integrators are symplectic and conserve momentum maps in the case of systems with symmetry. In addition to that, a new energy–momentum scheme is developed, which results from the discretization of the Euler–Lagrange equations pertaining to the GGL variational principle. The numerical properties of the newly devised schemes are investigated in representative examples of constrained mechanical systems.},

abstract = {Abstract The purpose of this work is twofold. First, we demonstrate analytically that the classical Newmark family as well as related integration algorithms are variational in the sense of the Veselov formulation of discrete mechanics. Such variational algorithms are well known to be symplectic and momentum preserving and to often have excellent global energy behaviour. This analytical result is verified through numerical examples and is believed to be one of the primary reasons that this class of algorithms performs so well. Second, we develop algorithms for mechanical systems with forcing, and in particular, for dissipative systems. In this case, we develop integrators that are based on a discretization of the Lagrange d'Alembert principle as well as on a variational formulation of dissipation. It is demonstrated that these types of structured integrators have good numerical behaviour in terms of obtaining the correct amounts by which the energy changes over the integration run.
